# Book App
Functionallities:
- List all books
- Search for a specific book
- Add new books as administrator

### What did I use to make this project ?
I used Node.js as the runtime and I used Express.js for the webserver. 
I am storing all the data in a MySQL database.
For the frontend am I using a template engine called EJS.

Modules used in this project:
- express
- morgan
- body-parser
- mysql
- ejs

### Why is it not working on my machine ?
I am using a local database to store all the books so you will need to get a mysql database running if you want to test this application.
