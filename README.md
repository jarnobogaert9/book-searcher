# Book App
Functionallity:
- See all books there are
- Search for a book
- Login as admin and add books

### What is used to make this project ?
I am using Node.js and on top off that I use the Express.js framework. 
I am storing all the data in a MySQL database.
For the frontend am I using a template engine called EJS.

Modules used in this project:
- express
- morgan
- body-parser
- mysql
- ejs

### Why is it not working on my machine ?
This is simple, all the books are stored in a local MySQL database. As a result you need to create a local database that you can call what you want (bookSystem is mine) with all the needed tables and rows.
